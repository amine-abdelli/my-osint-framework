# 🔍 Comprehensive OSINT Investigator Cheat Sheet

## 🎯 Purpose
Quick-reference OSINT cheat sheet covering tools, commands, and services integrated into the OSINT Investigator Playbook for rapid investigation lookup.

## ⚙️ Function
Tabular reference for: domain/IP tools (whois, nslookup, Shodan, Censys, theHarvester), email tools (HaveIBeenPwned, Hunter.io, EmailRep), social media OSINT, image OSINT (reverse search, ExifTool), dark web search, and Google dork operators.

## 🏆 Goal
Serve as a working reference during an active investigation - covering what tool to use for which data type and the key commands/URLs without having to dig through longer guides.

## 📋 When to Use
- During an active OSINT investigation needing a quick tool lookup
- Preparing for a recon engagement and reviewing available tools
- Quick reference for Google dork syntax or API endpoint formats

A quick-reference guide for the tools, services, and commands integrated into the **OSINT Investigator Playbook**. 

## 🎯 Purpose
Quick-command lookup organized by investigation phase (identity, infrastructure, web crawling, phone, analysis/automation), tied directly to the tools used in [Playbook/investigation_guide.md](Playbook/investigation_guide.md). Distinct from [OSINT_GUIDE.md](../OSINT/OSINT_GUIDE.md) (full methodology/background) and [OSINT_TOOLS_CATALOG.md](OSINT_TOOLS_CATALOG.md) (exhaustive tool directory) - this file is just the commands, phase-ordered.

## ⚙️ Function
Five investigation phases (identity/social, infrastructure/domain, web crawling/historical, communication/phone, analysis/automation) each with a tool table and copy-paste commands, plus an evidence-preservation section (hashing, archiving) and essential Linux one-liners.

## 🏆 Goal
Have the exact command syntax on hand for each investigation phase without re-deriving flags from tool documentation mid-investigation.

## 📋 When to Use
- Mid-investigation command lookup once you already know your methodology (see OSINT_GUIDE.md if you don't)
- Preserving evidence with proper hashing/archiving before compiling a final report

## 💾 Evidence Preservation & Playbook Operations
*Crucial steps for ensuring findings are documented, hashed, and forensically sound.*

### Investigator Playbook Configuration
*   **Initialize Case:** Select `[1]` in the main menu to set up forensic directories.
*   **Log Location:** `${HOME}/.config/osint-investigator/logs/`
*   **API Config:** Edit `api_keys.conf` to enable Shodan, VirusTotal (VT), and HIBP.
*   **Evidence Export:** Move all critical findings to `${CASE_DIR}/evidence/` for the final report.

### Preservation Commands
```bash
# Capture a self-contained HTML archive of a webpage
monolith https://target.com -o evidence_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).html

# Capture a full-page screenshot
cutycapt --url=https://target.com --out=screenshot.png

# Force a target page to be archived in the Wayback Machine
waybackpy --url "https://target.com" --save

# Generate a Hash Manifest to prove file integrity
sha256sum evidence_*.html screenshot_*.png > evidence_hashes.txt
```
